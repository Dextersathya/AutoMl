# AutoNickML

AutoNickML is a user-friendly machine learning application built using **Streamlit** that helps users quickly explore, profile, and model their datasets. With an intuitive interface, it allows users to upload datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) through data profiling, and download the best model for their data. This project can be useful for data scientists, analysts, and anyone looking to simplify the initial steps of the machine learning pipeline.

## Features

- **Upload**: Upload your dataset in CSV format for analysis.
- **Profiling**: Automatically generate an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report using **YData Profiling** (formerly Pandas Profiling).
- **Modelling**: (To be implemented) Build machine learning models for your dataset and select the best performing model.
- **Download**: Download the best performing model after training.

## Tech Stack

- **Streamlit**: For building the web app UI.
- **Pandas**: For handling and processing data.
- **YData Profiling (Pandas Profiling)**: For generating the EDA report.
- **Plotly Express**: For interactive data visualizations (if needed in future features).
- **Streamlit Pandas Profiling**: For integrating data profiling into the Streamlit app.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AutoNickML.git
cd AutoNickML
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application
To start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the application in your default browser.

## Usage

### 1. Upload Dataset
- Go to the **Upload** section on the sidebar and upload your CSV file.
- The uploaded dataset will be displayed on the main screen.

### 2. Profiling
- Navigate to the **Profiling** section in the sidebar.
- The app will generate a detailed exploratory data analysis report for the dataset, which includes statistics, visualizations, and insights into missing data, correlations, and more.

### 3. Modelling (To Be Implemented)
- This feature will allow users to select machine learning models, train them on the uploaded dataset, and provide options for hyperparameter tuning.

### 4. Download Model
- After building and selecting the best model (in future versions), you can download it in a `.pkl` format from the **Download** section.

## Future Improvements

- **Model Building**: Add automated machine learning (AutoML) features to build and evaluate machine learning models.
- **Visualization**: Provide interactive visualizations using Plotly Express for data analysis.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Add an option for users to fine-tune models.
